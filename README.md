## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
  - To build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow(keras) for melanoma detection from images. 
- What is the background of your project?
  - Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
  - To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. 
- What is the dataset that is being used?
  - The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

## Conclusions
- There is a class imbalance in the dataset with certain classes dominating over others
  - actinic keratosis-114 samples
  - basal cell carcinoma - 376 samples
  - dermatofibroma -  - 95 samples
  - melanoma - 438 samples 
  - nevus - 357 samples 
  - pigmented benign keratosis - 462 samples 
  - seborrheic keratosis - 77 samples 
  - squamous cell carcinoma - 181 samples 
  - vascular lesion - 139 samples
- Without Batch Normalisation and dropout the model overfits and the accuracy is also low
- Conclusion 2 from the analysis
- Conclusion 3 from the analysis
- Conclusion 4 from the analysis
